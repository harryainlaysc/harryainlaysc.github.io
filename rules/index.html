			<div class="gameRules weight300">1. Attendance for each event is at 12:15. Meet your team’s host and show them your Student ID card to check in. Teams must have a minimum of eight team members present to participate.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">2. All team members must have their Student Council fees paid before the first event. Those who fail to comply will not be allowed to participate.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">3. Events will begin promptly at 12:20 each day.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">4. It is the captain’s responsibility to make sure that their team members are aware of the rules, including the rules specific to each event.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">5. All participants are expected to display behaviour that is consistent with the Titan virtues.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">6. Tournament Management has the right to eliminate any individual whose behaviour interferes with the event.  </div>

			<h1 class="text-center showcaseTitle weight300">SPIRIT POINTS</h1>

			<h1 class="text-center showcaseTitle weight300">Semifinals: Human Battleship</h1>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">1. Check-in is at 12:15 in the gym as usual.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">2. Two rounds will run simultaneously, each with one team against another.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">3. The two teams playing each other will be separated by a barrier so that they cannot see one another.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">4. Team members will form battleships by sitting in groups of 1-4 people on their half of the playing field.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">5. One player at a time will be given a dodgeball to throw over the barricade. If the ball hits a member of the opposite team (bounces don’t count), that player will have to leave the playing field, so the team will know that they have hit a link of a battleship.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">6. So, teams should be quiet so they don’t give away their positions.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">7. Members of the tournament committees will retrieve the dodgeballs in between turns and give them to players so that all players have a turn to throw.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">8. Players are not allowed to move to throw the dodgeball or to avoid being hit.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">9. Players are not allowed to communicate with anyone other than their teammates to help them locate the other team’s battleships.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">10. Teams that do not follow the rules may lose turns or may have other penalties imposed on them. </div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">11. Once a player has been hit and has left the playing area, they may not communicate with their teammates who are still in the game. </div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">12. The team that eliminates their opponent's battleships first will win the game and will advance to the finals. If the game is not finished within the time limit, the team with the most remaining players will advance.</div>

			<h1 class="text-center showcaseTitle weight300">POINTS UPDATE</h1>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">Because of the amount of complaints of cheating during the quarterfinals (from both teams and teacher supervisors), the points system has been carried over for one more day to fairly decide who will advance to the semifinals. Teams were awarded points based on their placement within their round, and were deducted points for cheating. Congratulations to all teams on their participation so far!</div>
