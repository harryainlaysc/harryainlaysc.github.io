			<h1 class="text-center showcaseTitle weight300">GENERAL RULES</h1>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">1. Attendance for each event is at 12:15. Meet your team’s host and show them your Student ID card to check in. Teams must have a minimum of eight team members present to participate.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">2. All team members must have their Student Council fees paid before the first event. Those who fail to comply will not be allowed to participate.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">3. Events will begin promptly at 12:20 each day.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">4. It is the captain’s responsibility to make sure that their team members are aware of the rules, including the rules specific to each event.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">5. All participants are expected to display behaviour that is consistent with the Titan virtues.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">6. Tournament Management has the right to eliminate any individual whose behaviour interferes with the event.  </div>
		</div>
		<div class="container-fluid showcase" >
			<h1 class="text-center showcaseTitle weight300">SPIRIT POINTS</h1>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">1. All team members are dressed according to their team’s theme <b>3 points per event</b></div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">2. 100% attendance from a team for all events during the accumulation of points (the first five days) <b>10 points</b></div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">3. The team’s Teacher Sponsor is present at an event <b>1 point per event</b></div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">4. The team’s Teacher Sponsor is dressed according to their team’s theme <b>1 point per event</b></div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">5. Tournament Management has the right to deduct points for actions or behaviours that do not display Titan virtues (i.e., cheating does not display honesty, etc.) <b>5 points per infraction</b></div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">6. Likewise, Tournament Management has the right to award points for action or behaviours that do display Titan virtues <b>5 points</b></div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">7. Points may be awarded or deducted based on a team’s behaviour towards their Teacher Sponsor, their host, Tournament Management and other event supervisors (i.e., did you thank your Teacher Sponsor and your host?) </div>

			<h1 class="text-center showcaseTitle weight300">Day 1: Family Feud (Game 1)</h1>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">1. At the beginning of the event, you will need to find your team’s station in the rotunda. Each team has a poster with their team name on it. Your host will be at your table with this poster. Get to know your host a little bit--they will stay with your team throughout the tournament. For the first event, they will start by taking attendance and checking that Student Council fees have been paid by all team members. Remember: the event starts promptly at 12:20, so all team members must be signed in a few minutes prior.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">2. The game itself is quite simple. The question will be displayed on the projector, and as in Family Feud, it is up to your team to list as many answers as you think apply to the category. Teams will be given 20 seconds to write their answers on their whiteboard.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">3. When time is up, the acceptable answers will be revealed on the projector.  Your team’s host will check how many your team guessed correctly and record that number on the score sheet. For every correct answer, teams will be awarded one point. There will be no penalty for incorrect guesses.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">4. Although teams are encouraged to work together to answer the questions, they are not permitted to directly consult the crowd or use technology to help them. Cheating (including looking at other teams’ whiteboards) will not be tolerated and will result in a deduction of points.   </div>
