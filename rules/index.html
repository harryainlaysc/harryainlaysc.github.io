			<div class="gameRules weight300">1. Attendance for each event is at 12:15. Meet your team’s host and show them your Student ID card to check in. Teams must have a minimum of eight team members present to participate.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">2. All team members must have their Student Council fees paid before the first event. Those who fail to comply will not be allowed to participate.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">3. Events will begin promptly at 12:20 each day.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">4. It is the captain’s responsibility to make sure that their team members are aware of the rules, including the rules specific to each event.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">5. All participants are expected to display behaviour that is consistent with the Titan virtues.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">6. Tournament Management has the right to eliminate any individual whose behaviour interferes with the event.  </div>

			<h1 class="text-center showcaseTitle weight300">Day 4: Ainlay Amazing Race</h1>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">1. Attendance is at 12:15 in the rotunda.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">2. The race begins and ends in the rotunda. Each team will be assembling a puzzle. To earn your puzzle pieces, your team must solve a riddle. </div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">3. To begin this event, each team will be given a puzzle piece with a room number written on the back. This is your first destination. In each room, a tournament host will be there to give teams riddles to solve. When your team correctly solves the riddle, the host will give you your puzzle piece with the next room number written on it.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">4. Teams must work together to solve the riddles. Splitting up is not allowed (and it won’t really help you). Teams are also not allowed to use technology to help solve the riddles, or ask other spectators or teams for help. </div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">5. Follow the order indicated by your puzzle pieces: no stopping into the nearest room.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">6. Your last puzzle piece will prompt you to return to the rotunda. Points will be awarded to teams in the order that they finish assembling their puzzles.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">7. Keep all of your puzzle pieces with you while you are collecting them from different rooms. You can assemble the puzzle all at once you have collected them all and have returned to the rotunda. When your puzzle is completed, your team should put up their hands so that the tournament executive can keep track of the order in which teams finish.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">8. A time limit of 20 minutes will be imposed, meaning that teams should be back in the rotunda at 12:40. Any teams that return after the time limit will be ranked based on how many puzzle pieces they have acquired but may face a penalty for being late. A few minutes before 12:40, hosts will remind any teams in their rooms of the time deadline. No puzzle pieces will be given out after 12:40.</div>
			<div class="gameRules weight300">9. Please be respectful in the hallways and in the various classrooms. </div>
